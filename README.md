# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project implements **Simple** and **Multiple Linear Regression** using the `scikit-learn` library to predict house prices based on various features such as area, bedrooms, location, and amenities.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains information on houses and their attributes:

| Feature            | Description                                     |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `Price`            | Price of the house                              |
| `Area`             | Area in square feet                             |
| `Bedrooms`         | Number of bedrooms                              |
| `Bathrooms`        | Number of bathrooms                             |
| `Stories`          | Number of floors                                |
| `Mainroad`         | Connected to main road (Yes/No)                 |
| `Guestroom`        | Has guestroom (Yes/No)                          |
| `Basement`         | Has basement (Yes/No)                           |
| `Hotwaterheating`  | Has hot water heating (Yes/No)                 |
| `Airconditioning`  | Has air conditioning (Yes/No)                  |
| `Parking`          | Number of parking spaces                        |
| `Prefarea`         | Preferred area (Yes/No)                         |
| `Furnishing Status`| Fully, Semi or Unfurnished                      |

##Tasks Performed
ðŸ”¹ Data Preprocessing
Converted binary categorical variables (Yes/No â†’ 1/0)

Encoded Furnishing Status using one-hot encoding

Handled missing values (if any)

ðŸ”¹ Simple Linear Regression
Used Area to predict Price

Plotted regression line

ðŸ”¹ Multiple Linear Regression
Used all relevant features

Evaluated using:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

MSE (Mean Squared Error)

RÂ² Score

ðŸ”¹ Visualization
Plotted Actual vs Predicted prices

(Optional) Residual plots

ðŸ“ˆ Sample Output
Evaluation Metrics (Multiple Linear Regression):

MAE: ~970,000

MSE: ~1.75e+12

RÂ² Score: ~0.65

ðŸ“Š Interpretation of Results
RÂ² Score ~0.65 indicates that about 65% of the variance in house prices is explained by the model. While not perfect, it's a reasonably good fit for real-world data.

MAE (~970k) and MSE (~1.75e+12) suggest that there is still a significant error in absolute and squared terms. MAE gives an average deviation of nearly â‚¹9.7 lakhs.

The Actual vs Predicted scatter plot shows that most points are fairly close to the red line (ideal prediction), but there is some scatterâ€”especially at higher prices. This means the model is reasonably accurate, but errors increase for high-priced houses.
